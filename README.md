# NEAR Events
This is the place for NEAR Events to be submitted by anyone.  Events include:

1. Events you want a team from NEAR to officially support and attend
2. Events you want some other form of support from NEAR (whether technical, logistical or sponsorship).
    
    
## How do I submit a NEAR Event?
Submit it as an issue. Be sure to add the appropriate tags, and follow the template.

Required Tags:
1. Location -- pick a continent from the tags list
2. Type of support - pick between `sponsored`, `attendance`, `help wanted`, or any combo of the three

## What happens next?

Events are reviewed as part of a weekly process (to be made public soon).  This may result in additional questions, tags, etc to see if there are enough resources to participate in the event and add it to a team's calendar.
    
## How are decisions made?

We have to weigh an incredibly busy calendar and financial constraints against the expected impact we can have by participating in or supporting an event.  We're pretty darn effective but not superhuman -- and we prefer to do an incredible job with a small number of events rather than just showing up to a large number.

Specifically, these are the key criteria we consider:

1. Impact -- how many developers will actually build on NEAR as a result of this?  Are we able to speak to a very large audience (and generate impact in press or other content channels as well)?
2. Time cost -- How many people and how much focus will it require from a NEAR team?
3. Monetary cost -- How much will it cost to sponsor, provide prizes, travel to and set up the event?
4. Available resources -- for us to support an event, it takes at least 3 people's full time effort during the event and we have to make sure we can do this, particularly in light of the travel requirements.
5. Opportunity cost -- what other events are happening at the same time that we may already be attending or interested in?

Basically, the best events involve high impact speaking opportunities and interaction with many developers and don't require substantial travel from core team members.
